# Notes on downloads folder

Some of the downloads live here in the form of ZIP files.
Some of them are directly pulled from their github repositories.

Look at the links in the ../index.md file and you will see both references to downloads/*zip and git repos.

T7-4 is big and has lots of binary data in it so it's not stored as a separate Github repo,
it's just here in downloads/
and the folder inside there called RuleExports is actually a separate repository "RuleExports".

ORMAPTools has an awkward structure, it's got a toolbox (TBX file) and then a folder
with several Python files. It is copied into T7-4

ORMAPTasks is not under version control (except in downloads),
tasks files are zip files containing XML files,
all very convoluted and binary.
