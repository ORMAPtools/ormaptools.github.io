The github project is the web page. 

Look in https://ormaptools.github.io/

# When Dean shares new files,

1. Unzip them, do any needed polishing.
2. If anything changed, zip them and name them as needed.
3. Check them into github and tag as a new release.
4. Move the old zip files in downloads/ into ARCHIVE/
5. Put the zip files in ormaptools.github.io/downloads.
6. Update the .MD files
7. Commit, Push, done!

# How do I "6. Update the .MD files"?

They are just text files in "markdown" format. Use an editor. 
VS Code has a preview mode. 
Look up "github markdown" to learn about it. The github version
is slightly different than generica markdown.

You edit them and then 
in step 7 when they get pushed to github, it will trigger an action
that converts them into HTML files. I am not sure how long it takes
the action to run but it's magical. They just turn into HTML.
